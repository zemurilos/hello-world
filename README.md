Hello!
My name is Murilo, I'm 19 years old(Born-1998) xD.
I'm learning about git and how to use github, I'm studying and learning more about arduino, esp and libraries for my
college project.
I'm studying and learning more about eletronic, and programming, and how to unify them.
I like to study languages, practice sports.
I will write more below about what I'm currently doing at github...
